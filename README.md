# prime-factorization
I think, at least, a pretty clever prime factorization algorithm.

I thought of the algorithm independently, though I'm sure it already exists. Either way, I felt pretty good when I thought of it and decided to code it. Of course, I used Python. I plan to implement it in Ruby, as well.

I originally started writing it in Python v3.5.2 but I finished it in Python v2.7.6
